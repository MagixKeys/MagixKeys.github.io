        <p>What if your smartphone or tablet could whisper directly into your computer keyboard… without touching a single key?</p>
        <p>Meet Magix Keys – an app that will revolutionize the way you interact with your PC and other electronic devices controlled by a keyboard and mouse.</p>

          <li>Dictaphone with AI speech recognition</li>

        <h2>Scan Data via your Smartphone's Camera</h2>
        <p>Use your smartphone or tablet's camera to scan documents — whether they're receipts, barcodes, tracking numbers, forms, or even handwritten notes — and extract the text you need. The text will then be automatically "typed" for you on the connected device.</p>

        <h3>Scan Documents in No Time</h3>
        <p>Do you want to quote passages from a book, digitize a magazine article, or import data from a spreadsheet? It has never been easier than with the Magix Keys App.</p>
        <p>Just point your smartphone camera at the document to capture it. The built-in OCR feature extracts the text and lets you easily select the relevant parts. Then, with a single click, transfer this text to your word processor, email, or spreadsheet. The text will appear there, just as if you had typed it by hand.</p>

        <p>You can then let the Magix Keys App easily transfer the captured text excerpt to your PC.</p>

        <p>We’ve all been there: You step away for a few minutes, and your PC goes to sleep. Or worse, your status in MS Teams, Slack, or Zoom turns to "Away" even though you're still actively working - just not at the keyboard.</p>

        <h1>Connection Options - Two Powerful Ways to Connect</h1>
        <p>The Magix Keys App offers two ways to control your computer or device: via a direct Bluetooth connection and the Magix Keys Dongle.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="jiggler">
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>The direct Bluetooth mode is very convenient, but may not work reliably on all systems or platforms. That’s where the Magix Keys Dongle comes in — providing maximum compatibility, ease of use and seamless performance across all platforms.</p>
        <p>You only need the Magix Keys Dongle if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Android phone/tablet doesn’t support Bluetooth Human Interface Device (HID) mode</li>
          <li>Your target device has no Bluetooth interface (e.g., some TVs and embedded devices)</li>
          <li>You want convenient plug-and-play support, with no Bluetooth pairing setup</li>

        <h2>What is the Magix Keys Dongle?</h2>
        <p>The Magix Keys dongle is a very handy USB device, roughly the size of a coin, that fits in any pocket and acts as a wireless receiver for the Magix Keys App. It enables your smartphone or tablet to send keyboard and mouse commands to nearly any device — even if that device doesn’t provide a Bluetooth interface or your smartphone / tablet doesn't support the Bluetooth HID mode.</p>
        <p>It's based on the widely available M5Stack Atom S3 Lite development board — a compact and powerful ESP32-S3-based microcontroller with a USB-C interface that can either be flashed by yourself (DIY) or be obtained pre-flashed.</p>

          <li>Instant, reliable pairing — no manual configuration required</li>
